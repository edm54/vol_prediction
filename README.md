# vol_prediction
This project will attempt to predict changes in the implied volatility (IV) of stocks, commodities and indexes over a given period. In the stock market, volatility measures how much the market moved relative to its expectation. Essentially, the volatility can be calculated using the standard deviation of a given period of stock prices. This calculation will yield the “realized volatility” or historical volatility. On the other hand, IVis a measure of market risk and investor sentiment, and represents the expected volatility for the next 30-days. 

The IV is typically predicted based on the price of options 30 days from expiration. For example, the IV of the S\&P 500 is calculated using the prices of options on the SPX index. Options become more valuable when the market is expected to be more volatile. Therefore, being able to predict changes in volatility can be used as a profitable trading strategy. When volatility is expected to expand, buying options can be profitable, and when volatility is expected to decrease, selling options is expected to be profitable.
